NEXTLEVEL COMBAT STORE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This project is an e-commerce management system that provides a centralized platform to manage the company's products and merchandise. It allows for tracking records of past orders, current inventory, and enables the addition, updating, or deletion of new products. Additionally, the system facilitates the management of user/client records through various entities or models and their relationships. The project is structured into several folders, including controllers, config, entity, repository, security, and service, each containing relevant files. Technologies utilized in this project include Java, Bootstrap, MySQL, Hibernate, the Spring Framework (including Spring Security), CSS, JavaScript, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and HTML.

Access to the application requires login credentials consisting of a username and password. Currently, there are three user roles: superuser, employee or manager, and admin. Upon logging in, users are directed to the homepage, which displays the system name and provides access to various links.

The second tab, "Available Merchandise," allows users to view previously ordered items, which can be reordered from wholesale sellers in large quantities. Users can also view pictures of the merchandise, update quantities, and adjust agreed-upon prices. Products are tracked using their names or IDs. Reordered items can be moved to "My Merchandise," a tab displaying the current store inventory. Once items are sold out, they can be removed from the system.

The "New Merchandise Register" tab enables the addition of new products to the inventory, allowing users to input product names, images, and other relevant details before submitting them to the available merchandise list. These tabs collectively handle the CRUD operations for merchandise and products.

On the far right of the navigation, there are additional tabs: "Manage Users," which displays user information, including names and phone numbers, and allows for editing or deletion; "Add User," which facilitates the addition of new users to the Manage Users list; and finally, a "Logout" tab for signing off from the system.
